# Web3-Onboard

The best way to connect a wallet ðŸš€

<img src="{walletModal}" />

Web3-Onboard is the quickest and easiest way to add multi-wallet and multi-chain support to your project. With built-in modules for more than 35 unique hardware and software wallets, Web3-Onboard saves you time and headaches.

### Features

### Minimal Dependencies

All wallet dependencies are included in separate packages,
so you only include the ones you want to use in your app.

### Multiple Wallets and Accounts Connection, Multichain Support

Allow your users to connect multiple wallets and multiple accounts within each wallet at the same time to your app. Let users switch between chains/networks with ease.

### Unified Provider Interface

All wallet modules expose a provider that is patched to be compliant with the EIP-1193, EIP-1102, EIP-3085 and EIP-3326 specifications.
Whether your user is using Ledger or Metamask the provider will operate identically.

### Dynamic Imports

Supporting multiple wallets in your app requires a lot of dependencies. Onboard dynamically imports a wallet
and it's dependencies only when the user selects it, so that minimal bandwidth is used.

### Framework Agnostic

Avoid framework lock in -- Web3-Onboard works with any framework and includes helper packages for vue & react.

### Account Center

An interface to manage wallet connections and networks, with a minimal version for mobile

### Notify

Real-time transaction notifications for all transaction states for the connected wallet address(es). In-notification speedups & cancels for hardware wallet connections.
