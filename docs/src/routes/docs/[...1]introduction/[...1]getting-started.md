# Web3-Onboard

The best way to connect a wallet ðŸš€

<!-- <img src={walletModal} alt="" /> -->

Web3-Onboard is the quickest and easiest way to add multi-wallet and multi-chain support to your project. With built-in modules for more than 35 unique hardware and software wallets, Web3-Onboard saves you time and headaches.

### Features

### Minimal Dependencies

All wallet dependencies are included in separate packages,
so you only include the ones you want to use in your app.

### Multiple Wallets and Accounts Connection

Allow your users to connect multiple wallets and multiple accounts within each wallet at the same time to your app.

### Multiple Chain Support

Allow users to switch between chains/networks with ease.

### Unified Provider Interface

All wallet modules expose a provider that is patched to be compliant with the EIP-1193, EIP-1102, EIP-3085 and EIP-3326 specifications.
Whether your user is using Ledger or Metamask the provider will operate identically.

### Dynamic Imports

Supporting multiple wallets in your app requires a lot of dependencies. Onboard dynamically imports a wallet
and it's dependencies only when the user selects it, so that minimal bandwidth is used.

### Framework Agnostic

Avoid framework lock in -- Web3-Onboard works with any framework and includes helper packages for vue & react.
