# Customization

You can customize web3-onboard based on your design system to match the look & feel of your dapp. web3-onboard exposes css variables grouped for each of its UI components, including the Connect Wallet modal, Account Center, Notify, Hardware wallet modals, general styling, and other modals that are part of the user flows. For more information see the [custom styling section](https://onboard.blocknative.com/docs/packages/core#custom-styling).

### Theming

We have created a [theming tool](http://localhost:3000/theming) that allows you to customize a theme, see your theme on web3-onboard laid over app context from a screenshot or URL, and copy your theme file to be added to your site's main css file. We recommend using this tool to get started quickly, and dive into deep customization using the css variables to make web3-onboard feel pixel perfect in cohesion with your dapp.

### Fonts & Borders

There are css variables available in the custom styling section of the core module for you to customize the fonts & borders of web3-onboard to match your dapp.

### Stay tuned

We're dedicated to providing a seamless customization experience and will soon be providing more tools and examples to help our community get the most out of their web3-onboard implementation.
